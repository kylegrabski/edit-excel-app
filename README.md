# edit-excel-app
### __Proof of concept application.__ 

Allows users to upload Excel files (`.xlsx` or `.csv`).

The upload is then converted to JSON and is displayed on the screen that mimics an Excel file.

Users can then edit the values in the cells and can save the changes and download the updated file as `.xlsx` or `.csv`.
